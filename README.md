# Lindsey Stead

**Full-Stack Software Developer | Building and operating production SaaS systems**

I design, ship, and maintain real production software — from frontend interfaces to backend APIs, databases, integrations, and cloud deployments.

My focus is simple: build systems that are reliable, maintainable, and actually useful in the real world.

I’ve led features end-to-end, collaborated with product and design stakeholders, and owned deployments in live environments. I’m comfortable moving across the stack and ramping quickly on new technologies when projects demand it.
