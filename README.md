# Lindsey Stead

Full-Stack Software Developer building thoughtful, production-ready systems.

I design and ship real software used by real people — from frontend interfaces to backend APIs, databases, integrations, and cloud deployments. I care about clarity, reliability, and building systems that hold up in everyday use.

With a background in Computing Science, Health Sciences, and Psychology, I approach engineering with both technical rigor and human awareness. I enjoy translating messy real-world workflows into clean, maintainable software.

I’m comfortable owning features end-to-end — from early design discussions through deployment and iteration — and I ramp quickly when new tools or domains are involved.
