# Lindsey Stead

Full-Stack Software Developer building and operating production SaaS systems.

I design, build, and maintain end-to-end systems across frontend interfaces, backend APIs, relational data layers, integrations, and cloud deployments. My background in Computing Science, Health Sciences, and Psychology shapes how I approach system design, usability, and long-term reliability in real operational environments.

I’m comfortable owning features from design through deployment, collaborating with product and design stakeholders, and ramping quickly on new languages or frameworks as projects evolve.
